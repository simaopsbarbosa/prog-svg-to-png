## Accomplished tasks

Implemented the `readSVG` function, designed to read and process SVG files. The function handles loading SVG files, parsing their XML structure, and extracting relevant graphical data. This data is then made available for further manipulation or analysis within the application. The `readSVG` function ensures that the SVG content is accurately interpreted and represented in a usable format for subsequent operations. 

The `SVGElement` class facilitates the structured representation of SVG elements, simplifying tasks like rendering and attribute modification.
